    Your role is Column Access Detection: identify which columns from the dataset are accessed or utilized in the given code snippet so we can focus constraint generation on relevant columns.

    You will be given:
    1. A description of available dataset columns (columns_desc)
    2. A code snippet to analyze (code_script)
    3. A description of the downstream task (downstream_task_description)

    Your task:
    - Identify which columns are accessed, read, or used in the code
    - Only return column names that exactly match those in columns_desc
    - For derived columns, map them back to the original raw column names used
    - Return a list of column names (not comma-separated string, but a proper list)
    - If a column appears in conditionals, filters, transformations, or any data operations, include it

    Given a code snippet (with 1-based line numbers) and a target column name,
    identify every line that reads, writes, transforms, filters, merges, or
    otherwise interacts with the target column.

    Include lines that:
    - Directly access the column (e.g., ``df['col']``, ``df.col``)
    - Use derived variables that originated from the column
    - Pass the column through function calls or pipelines
    - Filter, group, or aggregate using the column

      1) Use exact 1-based line numbers from the snippet.
      2) Be exhaustive; any interacting line appears in at least one range.
      3) Adjacent lines should be merged into one range; non-adjacent are separate.
      4) Order of ranges does not matter.
      5) Output only JSON. No extra text.

class AssumptionExtractionSig(dspy.Signature):
    """You are an expert at analyzing data processing code to infer implicit data quality assumptions.

    Your task is to examine code that processes a dataset and identify what data quality constraints
    the code implicitly assumes or requires. These assumptions will be converted into validation rules.

    Types of assumptions to identify:
    1. **Completeness**: Code assumes no null/missing values (e.g., accessing column without null check)
    2. **Range**: Code filters or expects values within bounds (e.g., age >= 18, price > 0)
    3. **Enum/Categorical**: Code expects specific set of values (e.g., status in ['active', 'pending'])
    4. **Format**: Code expects specific format (e.g., regex patterns, date formats)
    5. **Uniqueness**: Code assumes unique values (e.g., using column as key/ID)
    6. **Statistical**: Code assumes distribution properties (e.g., mean, stddev bounds)
    7. **Relationship**: Code assumes relationships between columns (e.g., end_date > start_date)

    For each assumption you find:
    - Describe it clearly in natural language
    - Identify which column(s) are involved
    - Classify the constraint type
    - Estimate confidence (0.0-1.0) based on how explicit the assumption is
    - Note the specific line numbers where this assumption appears. The code is provided with line numbers. Lines relevant to the target column are highlighted with a ``-**->`` prefix (e.g., ``-**-> 0010: code here``). Non-highlighted lines use ``      0010: code here``. Focus your analysis on highlighted lines but use surrounding context for understanding. Use the exact line numbers in your output.

    Return assumptions as a list of dictionaries with these keys:
    {
        "text": "Natural language description",
        "columns": ["column_name"],
        "type": "completeness|range|enum|format|uniqueness|statistical|relationship",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "source_lines": [10, 11]

    Your task is to transform code assumptions into formal validation rules. You will generate rules

    1. Code snippet being analyzed

    5. Available GX expectation function signatures
    6. Available Deequ constraint function signatures

    Your goal is to map each assumption to the appropriate validation rule(s) in both formats.

    For Great Expectations, use function call format like:

    - expect_column_values_to_be_between(column="age", min_value=18, max_value=65)
    - expect_column_values_to_be_in_set(column="status", value_set=["active", "pending", "closed"])

    For Deequ, use method call format like:
    - .isComplete("name")
    - .isContainedIn("age", 18.0, 65.0)
    - .isContainedIn("status", Array("active", "pending", "closed"))
